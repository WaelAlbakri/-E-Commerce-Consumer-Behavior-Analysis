# 📈 E-Commerce Customer Behavior & Revenue Analysis

## Overview
This data science project explores customer behavior patterns to determine which platform **mobile app** or **website* more strongly influences annual customer spending. The project highlights how relying on surface-level data (such as time spent on a platform) can be misleading without deeper statistical analysis.

---

## 📊 Objective
To identify key behavioral drivers of customer spending and develop a predictive model that helps businesses make strategic marketing and product investment decisions.

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Time on App** has a **strong positive correlation** with yearly customer spending.
- **Time on Website**, while higher on average, has **no meaningful correlation** and can often be misleading.
- **Customer attention and intent differ across platforms**—mobile users are more focused, while website users tend to multitask or idle.
- These insights align with common UX patterns known to professionals familiar with **heatmaps** and **session replays**.

---

## 🛠️ Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized relationships using pairplots and correlation heatmaps.
   - Analyzed behavioral features like session length, time on app, and time on website.

2. **Regression Modeling**  
   - Built a multiple linear regression model to predict `Yearly Amount Spent`.
   - Interpreted model coefficients to quantify platform impact.

3. **Result Interpretation**  
   - Used statistical insights to inform marketing strategy and platform investment decisions.
